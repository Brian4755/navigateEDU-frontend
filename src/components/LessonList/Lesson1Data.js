    header: <h1 className="lessonOneHeader">This is a Browser</h1>,
    content: <p className="lessonOneDescription">What is a browser, you ask?

    You’re actually using one right now! Browsers are the applications that you use to browse the internet. 
    
    Some examples include Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. Chances are good that you’re using one of those browsers right now!</p>

  {
    header: <h1 className="lessonOneHeader">The URL Bar</h1>,
    content: <p className="lessonOneDescription">URL is an abbreviation for “Uniform Resource Locator.” Its a technical sounding name, but its actually just the address for any webpage on the internet. 
    <br/>
    Just like a street address in real life, the URL is a unique identifier to locate a specific web page.
    <br/>
    It usually starts with "http://" or "https://,” followed by the main section of the web address, which is called the domain. </p>

  {
    header: <h1 className="lessonOneHeader">Tabs</h1>,
    content: <p className="lessonOneDescription">Tabs are used within your  browser  so you can visit more than one web page at the same time. 

    You can open a new tab with the “+” button at the top of your browser. When you have 2 tabs open you can visit 2 different websites without closing the first one.
    
    If you want to close a tab, you can simply hit the “x” button on the right side of the tab.</p>
  },
  {
    header: <h1 className="lessonOneHeader">Bookmarks</h1>,
    content: <p className="lessonOneDescription">Bookmarks are a way to create a list of your favorite webpages. 

    Just like a bookmark in real life, it saves your place so you don’t have to search for the page again. Bookmarking a page saves it to a list that you can easily access in your browser window.
    
    Its a super convenient feature that saves time when you want to visit the same web page in the future!</p>
  },
  {
    header: <h1 className="lessonOneHeader">Back/Forward Buttons</h1>,
    content: <p className="lessonOneDescription">Need to go back to the previous page?

    The Back button, typically represented by a left-pointing arrow, takes you back to the previous webpage you visited. 
    
    The Forward button, usually represented by a right-pointing arrow, comes into play after you've used the Back button. Once you've gone back, the Forward button becomes active, allowing you to move forward again.</p>
  },
  {
    header: <h1 className="lessonOneHeader">Learn How to Refresh</h1>,
    content: <p className="lessonOneDescription">Sometimes, when you visit a webpage, the information displayed may become outdated or you may encounter technical issues. 
    
    That's when the Refresh button comes to the rescue. By clicking it, your browser will fetch the most recent version of the page from the internet and replace the existing content with the fresh data.
    </p>
  },
  {
    header: <h1 className="lessonOneHeader">History</h1>,
    content: <p className="lessonOneDescription">If you forgot to bookmark a valuable page during your last session, check your history!  

    The History button is a valuable feature in your web browser that keeps track of the webpages you've visited during your browsing sessions. It acts as a digital record of your online activity, allowing you to view and revisit previously visited sites. 
    </p>
  },
  {
    header: <h1 className="lessonOneHeader">Closing Pages</h1>,
    content: <p className="lessonOneDescription">Ready to go? Clicking the closing button terminates the browser window and ends the browsing session. 

    If you don’t want to end your session, you can click the minimizing button allowing you to access other screens while keeping the browser easily accessible.
    
    To restore your session, click the maximizing button to expand the browser to fill your screen again!
